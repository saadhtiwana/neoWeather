# 🌩️ NeoWeather: The Last Weather App You'll Ever Need (Or Not) 🚀  

## 🌎 Overview  

![NeoWeather](neoweather.jpg)  

Hey there, fellow weather geeks, apocalypse preppers, and people who just wanna know if their picnic will be ruined! ☔ Welcome to **NeoWeather**, the only app that predicts rain before your joints start aching. 🦵💨  

## 🤖 What’s This Sci-Fi Sorcery?  

NeoWeather isn’t just a weather app—it’s a **weather revolution**. We threw away the old-school thermometers, summoned AI-powered storm gods, and created a **futuristic** weather experience that even Elon Musk would approve of. ⚡  

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (a.k.a. "The Weather Matrix")  

- **Next.js (2025 Edition)** – Because React alone wasn’t cyberpunk enough. 🚀  
- **React** – UI so smooth, even your grandma can swipe through it.  
- **TypeScript** – Because writing JavaScript without types is like flying blind in a hurricane. 🌪️  
- **Tailwind CSS** – For people who like writing CSS at *warp speed*.  
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber** – Because *flat* weather apps are so 2025.  
- **Framer Motion** – Animations so fluid, they might just hypnotize you.  
- **Open-Meteo API** – Real-time weather with zero subscription fees (take that, capitalism).

2. **Holographic Weather Cards** 💎 – So futuristic, your screen might get jealous.  
3. **Cyberpunk UI** 🦾 – Because *boring* apps belong in 1999.  
4. **Real-Time Weather Updates** ⏳ – More accurate than your uncle’s *guesses*.
